      <ol><li>
      Some offline alternatives are available but it take user time and also pay some money. For example the user may go
      to some place to hire the transport for their picnic may take the user time and also pay some money for going to
      the bus stands and coming back to its destination. As compare to this our service is free and may save the valuable
      time of user as well as the money, because our service is available online and may be used from anywhere.
      As we know that time is very important factor and can never be recover. Our application
      will facilitate the user in this scenario.
      </li>
      <li>The second weak point of offline alternative is that, it is not available for 24 hours, but our service is
       online and available for 24 hours. The user have the ability to access it any time and get the information</li>
      <li>For hiring transport more than one bus station will be available. To find the cheap transport service
         may require more human resources. But in case of our application, it is online and may contains the information of different
        bus stations. Therefore, on single click the user have the ability to find the cheapest transport facility require less human being</li>

     Looking at a bigger scale, one of the best existing, most popular communities in our subject area would be tourismthailand.org. 
     It has a link to their own Facebook page which gives the advantage of a good publicity and forming bigger community.
     For transport they have a number of options to choose from and they also provide information about special offers and tourist   information centers
      </li>
	<li>
 Our website can be of a good use to Student Union of AIT to provide detailed information of destinations to the students including the prices. It can provide a platform to the users to share the trip with other people who are willing to go to the same place.
